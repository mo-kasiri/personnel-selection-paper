### Abstract

   The Multimedia industry is expanding quickly, and it is now crucial to employ an agile strategy when choosing designers for project managers. As various projects have specific requirements and managers are responsible for several projects simultaneously, selecting the most suitable designer requires a structured procedure. This research adopts the Bellman-Zadeh technique to identify freelance designers for Multimedia projects. The suggested approach is utilized in two case studies, one involving the use of objective data to select a designer and the other using subjective judgment to select designers with prior experience working with project managers. The findings show that our proposed technique effectively identifies the ideal candidate by considering the projectâ€™s needs.
